In the background of this project, koi fish farming is increasingly popular among ornamental fish enthusiasts. Poor water quality can cause stress in fish and even death, making it difficult for farmers. To solve this problem, Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies were developed for real-time monitoring of water quality. However, there is no sensor tool that is directly integrated with mobile applications. Therefore, it is necessary to develop advanced sensor technology that can measure water parameters in real-time and maintain stable water quality. This tool will be connected to a mobile application for remote monitoring and rapid response to changes in water conditions, and apply data-driven and machine learning approaches to analyze water quality data. Challenges remain in terms of accessibility and implementation costs. Thus, this proposal aims to develop an effective and connected solution for water quality monitoring to support successful koi fish farming.
