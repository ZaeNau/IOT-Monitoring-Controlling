Koi fish cultivation faces significant challenges due to the critical need for maintaining optimal water quality, as poor conditions can lead to fish stress, disease, and mortality. Despite advancements in IoT technology for water quality monitoring, there is a lack of integrated systems that offer both monitoring and automatic control via mobile applications. This research aims to develop an IoT-based system capable of real-time measurement of key water parameters—temperature, TDS, pH, ammonia levels, and turbidity—and automatic stabilization actions when parameters deviate from set thresholds. The proposed system will provide remote access and real-time data monitoring through a mobile app, thereby assisting koi breeders in maintaining water quality and ensuring fish well-being, while also addressing the challenges of accessibility and implementation costs for sustainable koi fish farming.
